# Notes on running FenicsX on Yellowstone

Activate conda environment (for testing):
```
eval "$(/opt/ohpc/pub/compiler/anaconda3/2024.02-1/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
conda activate fenicsx-env
```

Execute `generate_ys_scripts.py` to generate a set of run scripts. On yellowstone, just run `./run_all.sh` to submit all jobs.
